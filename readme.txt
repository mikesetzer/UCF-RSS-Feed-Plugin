== Development ==

Note that compiled, minified css and js files are included within the repo.  Changes to these files should be tracked via git (so that users installing the plugin using traditional installation methods will have a working plugin out-of-the-box.)

[Enabling debug mode](https://codex.wordpress.org/Debugging_in_WordPress) in your `wp-config.php` file is recommended during development to help catch warnings and bugs.

= Requirements =
* node
* gulp-cli

= Instructions =
1. Clone the UCF-RSS-Feed-Plugin repo into your local development environment, within your WordPress installation's `plugins/` directory: `git clone https://github.com/UCF/UCF-RSS-Feed-Plugin.git`
2. `cd` into the new UCF-RSS-Feed-Plugin directory, and run `npm install` to install required packages for development into `node_modules/` within the repo
3. Optional: If you'd like to enable [BrowserSync](https://browsersync.io) for local development, or make other changes to this project's default gulp configuration, copy `gulp-config.template.json`, make any desired changes, and save as `gulp-config.json`.

    To enable BrowserSync, set `sync` to `true` and assign `syncTarget` the base URL of a site on your local WordPress instance that will use this plugin, such as `http://localhost/wordpress/my-site/`.  Your `syncTarget` value will vary depending on your local host setup.

    The full list of modifiable config values can be viewed in `gulpfile.js` (see `config` variable).
3. Run `gulp default` to process front-end assets.
4. If you haven't already done so, create a new WordPress site on your development environment to test this plugin against.
5. Activate this plugin on your development WordPress site.
6. Configure plugin settings from the WordPress admin under "UCF RSS Feeds".
7. Run `gulp watch` to continuously watch changes to scss and js files.  If you enabled BrowserSync in `gulp-config.json`, it will also reload your browser when plugin files change.
